## The 3D half of one cue, above one voli's head.
##
## A separate node rather than more state inside `player_actor_3d.gd`, which is
## the file Codex's new models and VFX are about to rewrite; the whole point of
## keeping this component apart is that the two lines of work touch different
## nodes. The actor gains one child and one call.
##
## **Parity is on the description, not on the drawing.** The tactical board
## rasterises `CognitionBadge.describe` into arcs and polygons; this turns the
## same dictionary into a glyph and a colour. They will never look alike and
## must always mean alike, so anything that decides *meaning* -- which state, how
## urgent, whether the eye is open -- happens in the badge module and neither
## renderer is allowed a rule of its own.

const BadgeModel := preload("res://scripts/systems/cognition_badge.gd")

## The glyph for each badge shape. Chosen so the silhouette survives at the
## distance a stationary camera actually puts a player at, which ruled out the
## eye shapes that read fine at 20 px on the board and turn to mush here.

## The ambient tier: what a voli is doing when nothing more interesting is true
## of them.
##
## One mark per intent, grouped so a glance answers *which side of the ball* and
## a look answers the rest -- shields for the four ways of dealing with their
## ball, blades for the three ways of doing something to it, hands for the pivot,
## and a dot for a voli with nothing to add. The dot matters: without a mark,
## "no opinion" is indistinguishable from "not implemented", which is the state
## this layer started in at 0.75 volis of six.
const INTENT_GLYPHS := {

	"serving": "⇧", "preparing_attack": "⇡", "approaching": "⬆",
	"setting": "⌒", "watching": "•",
}
## `watching` was `·`, a middle dot, and it is **half of every mark drawn**.
##
## `run_cogniticon_screen_probe.gd`, eight rallies off the billboard nodes
## themselves: of the marks visible on screen, 49.2% are this one. It was also
## the least ink of any glyph in the set by a wide margin -- at the em size the
## ambient tier runs at, a middle dot is a few pixels.
##
## The comment above argues the dot has to exist, because without a mark "no
## opinion" is indistinguishable from "not implemented". An *invisible* dot
## fails that test by exactly the same argument, so it is a bullet: still the
## quietest thing in the vocabulary, still deliberately nothing in particular,
## but actually present.
## How far the ambient tier is held below the punctuating one.
##
## The whole two-tier rule in one number. An ambient mark is present on twelve
## volis at once and must never draw the eye; a state badge appears rarely and
## must be the only thing moving when it does. Sized and faded well under the
## badge so that going from 0.75 marks to twelve does not drown `lost_sight`,
## which fires 24 times in 47,000 cue-samples and lands because almost nothing
## else is lit.
## **The ambient tier was paying for quiet twice, and one of the two payments
## bought nothing.**
##
## It was 0.00010 against a badge running 0.00014 to 0.00022 -- 71% of the
## quietest badge and 45% of the loudest -- *and* held at 0.55 alpha. Reported
## from two frames of real playback: the marks cannot be made out at all, and
## the only ones legible on screen are the badge tier's solid diamonds.
##
## Size and contrast are not two ways of saying the same thing. **Size carries
## identity** -- which glyph is this, a shield or a blade -- and **contrast
## carries priority** -- should this pull my eye. Buying quiet with size spends
## the one thing the ambient layer exists for; `COGNITICONS.md` asks that "a
## glance anywhere on court tells you what that voli is doing", and a mark too
## small to identify answers that with nothing. Buying it with contrast costs
## only the pull, which is exactly what was meant to be given up.
##
## So the size goes up to where a shape is readable and the alpha comes down to
## pay for it. The two-tier rule is unchanged in its intent and now lives where
## it belongs: an ambient mark is *dimmer* than a state badge rather than
## smaller than one.

## distances the match centre actually uses. A head is a fine size for a mark you
## are looking for and too small for one you are supposed to read at a glance
## across twelve volis, which is what these are for.
##
## Every size below is a multiple of this, and the two-tier rule survives the
## scaling: ambient stays well under the state badge, because both move together.

## How much larger a drawn mark is than the character it replaces.
##
## A glyph is drawn at a font size and fills a fraction of its em box; a mark
## fills its own canvas edge to edge. Matched by eye against the plate so the
## two tiers keep the relationship the gate asserts -- the mark reads at the
## size the character was *supposed* to, rather than at the size it managed.
const MARK_PIXEL_RATIO: float = 0.82

## How far above the crown the mark sits, in metres.
##
## **The reason a mark felt detached from its voli.** It was centred *on*
## `_cognition_head_height`, which is the scalp -- so half the mark overlapped
## the head and half towered above it, and at `fixed_size` that half does not
## shrink with distance. A big shape straddling the top of a head reads as
## something hovering near the voli rather than as something belonging to them.
##
## Sitting it just clear of the crown instead, with the size down, puts the ink
## in the space directly above the head where a thought bubble goes. Small and
## in metres: the mark is screen-relative and this is not, so a large gap would
## open up as the camera pulled back.
## Half the mark hangs below its own centre, so the lift has to clear the crown
## *and* that half -- at 0.13 the grip sat on the voli's head. Sized against the
## badge tier's own 0.30, which has been sitting above heads without complaint.
const MARK_LIFT_METERS: float = 0.34

## **A drawn mark is opaque; the character it replaced was not.**
##
## `AMBIENT_ALPHA` is 0.40, and applying it here would have thrown away the
## whole reason the marks are drawn in ink and halo: the contrast *is* the
## legibility, and fading it to 40% puts back the problem the ink was chosen to
## solve. The two-tier rule survives elsewhere -- an ambient mark is a thin
## outline where a state badge is a solid glyph, so the badge still carries more
## weight at the same opacity.
##
## The fill sits under the outline at a lower share, so a full blade still reads
## as an edge with an interior rather than as a solid slab.
