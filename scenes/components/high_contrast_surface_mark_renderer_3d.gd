extends "res://scenes/components/surface_mark_renderer_3d.gd"

## Presentation refinement for the existing surface-mark authority.
##
## The base renderer owns mark identity, placement, surface masks and sticker-mask
## compatibility. This subclass changes only the pigment contrast that reaches the
## same shader. The direction of contrast is derived from the mesh's live base
## material, so a mark that was already lighter than a dark coat becomes lighter
## still, while a dark mark on a light coat becomes darker. No mark changes
## silhouette, geometry, or physical state.
