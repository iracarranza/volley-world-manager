## so every cycle covers two of those geometry-derived steps. That keeps the
## visible turnover tied to the body crossing the floor instead of to frame time.

## chain, particularly in shuffles. A bounded planar correction pays the
## remaining fore-aft and lateral slip without replacing the contact overlays
## that make a dig, set, or attack legible.

## How far off their facing a voli will travel before they give up and turn to
## run. Inside it they are shuffling or backpedalling with their eyes where they
## were; outside it the speed bounds below decide.
##
## **Sixty degrees, not ninety, and the difference is that the bounds below only
## exist at all at sixty.** A right angle put *perpendicular* travel exactly on
## the boundary, and the test is `<=`, so a voli moving straight sideways counted
## as inside the cone and turned onto their travel at any speed whatsoever. The
## lateral bound directly beneath this describes a middle shuffling the width of
## the net -- which is the perpendicular case -- so the number written to make a
## middle look like a middle could never fire for a middle. It governed only
## backward-diagonal travel, weighted by how sideways that diagonal was.
##
## The gate in `tests/test_runner.gd` found this the first time it was asked, by
## asserting the thing the constants claimed and getting back the opposite.
##
## Sixty is where a running gait stops being a run: past it the feet are crossing
## or shuffling whatever the facing says, so it is the honest place to hand the
## decision to speed. Measured over 4,727 off-ball legs, median travel is 1.5-2.4
## m/s in every angular band -- comfortably under both bounds -- so the change
## lands as "most volis now keep their eyes on the ball" rather than as a new

			##
			## Blended rather than switched, and by phase rather than by a timer,

	## measurement this model actually carries -- there is no separate inseam --
	## and it is compared against what this player's height would ordinarily
	## produce, so the scale reads "long-legged for their size" rather than
	## "tall".
	##
	## Total height is preserved. A player with the same height and longer legs

	## the legs gained and the feet stay on the floor. Without that the rig would

	## the whole difference went into a gap nobody could see. Two volis of the
	## same height with a 0.62 m and a 1.02 m stride should look like two
	## genuinely different builds, and the only way that happens is if the
	## torso gives back exactly what the legs take.
	##
	## So the upper body is compressed about the raised hip by the ratio of the

	## The hips sit on the hip joint, and this is where that is decided.

	## The shorts used to be placed from the *torso's* bottom, so a body type
	## with a tall torso pushed them down past the joint they are supposed to be
	## capping -- Stalk, Aubergine, Pear and Ursi worst, because their torsos are
	## the tallest. A block floating below the pelvis does not read as hips, it
	## reads as shorts worn badly.
	##
	## Derived here rather than in `_build_silhouette` because the hip has just
	## moved: two functions both placing the shorts is exactly the
	## correct-then-clobbered shape that has bitten this file three times, so the
	## one that knows the final hip height owns it outright.
	## **The shorts are the bottom of the torso, not a box on it.**
	##
	## They were a box wider than the body sitting at the waist, and under a drawn
	## line that box earned an outline of its own -- which is what turned a pair of
	## shorts into a shelf. A voli in a singlet does not have a ledge at the hip.
	##
	## So they are now a section of the torso's own profile: the same shape,
	## sampled at the height they sit at, a shade wider so they clear it without
	## fighting for pixels, and less than half its height so they read as the
	## bottom of a garment rather than as a second body. `_torso_radius_at` is the
	## same function the collar uses, for the same reason -- a band sized from the
	## widest point of a round body is a hoop somebody has been posted through.
	## **The shorts shell is gone.**
	##
	## It was a straight-sided section of the torso's own profile -- an unbroken
	## ring of dark right round the body, which is a skirt by construction and was
	## never shorts-shaped. Every problem attributed to it was really it: the
	## "torso extruding from the shorts" was its bottom face meeting the capsule's
	## cap in the same plane, and the overhang added to fix that governed a mesh
	## that should not have been drawn at all.
	##
	## What dresses the hips now is what a garment actually is: the hip joint
	## takes the shorts' colour, and `_add_garments` hangs a real leg opening on
	## each thigh. The node, its mesh resource, its share constant and its place
	## in the ink and mask lists are all removed rather than left hidden -- a mesh
	## kept alive at `visible = false` is the next person's mystery.

	## past the elbow, which sat at the upper bone's proper end, so every bent
	## pose came out as a T: a forearm crossing an upper arm at its middle.
	##
	## Correct-then-clobbered, and the third time in this file: something builds

## Where this voli's head actually is, in the actor's own space.
##
## **The height was a number, and a number cannot lean.** `_cognition_head_height`
## multiplies a rig constant by a body scale, which describes a voli standing to
## attention. Every voli on this court is in a ready stance with the trunk
## pitched forward, and `BodyPivot` carries that pitch -- so the head is a
## decimetre or so in *front* of the actor's origin and the mark was being hung
## above the origin, which is behind the head. Reported as marks reading behind
## and to the left of their volis, and that is most of it.
##
## Reading the node instead picks up everything that moves a head for free: the
## lean, the crouch, a jump's lift, the fold of a dig. A blocker at the top of
## their jump now carries their mark up with them, which the constant could not
## have done at any value.
##
## Falls back to the constant when the rig is not in the tree, which is the
## portfolio and unit-test case -- a pose set by hand before `_ready` has no
## global transforms to read.
## **The crown, not the head's centre.** A `MeshInstance3D`'s origin is the
## middle of its mesh, so anchoring to `head.global_position` hangs the mark
## half a head too low and the blade's grip lands on the voli's face. The mesh
## knows its own extent; asking it means a tall silhouette and a short one both
## get their mark clear of the hair rather than one of them wearing it.
