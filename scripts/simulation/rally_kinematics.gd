## Shared unit conversions for calculated rally timing. This class does not
## simulate aerodynamics or mutate rally state.
## Court geometry belongs to `CourtConstants`, which is where every other
## consumer reads it. Re-declaring the numbers here meant a court that changed
## size would silently change it in one place and not the other.

## outcome off where the ball lands; this one solves a drawn ground-to-ground arc,
## where the apex is the thing that has to stay believable. Two bounds, two
## purposes -- said out loud here because neither file previously acknowledged the
## other, and a reader of one would have taken it for the bound.
##
## Below this, a shot is flat enough that tan(theta) collapses toward zero and
## the required speed toward the distance/duration floor; above the max, apex
## height blows up implausibly at real court distances (an unclamped 80 degree
## shot over 9m implies a ~12.8m apex). Both bounds keep every derived value
## finite and keep the shape of the arc inside what a volleyball rally
## actually produces.

## requires to land on the known target -- that is what makes this force
## derived rather than a chosen duration. Distance and angle are cleared and
## clamped so no combination this is called with can produce NaN or Inf.

## The same solve as `solve_launch_arc`, for a ball that does not start and
## finish on the floor.
##
## Kept beside the level-ground one rather than replacing it, and every rally
## flight has moved onto this: a serve leaves a hand at 2.7 m, a set finishes in
## a hitter's reach at 3.1 m, and a dig is scooped off the floor at 0.9 m.
## Solving all three as though they left the ground and returned to it made the
## required speed wrong, and therefore the flight time wrong, in a way that no
## end-to-end check could see -- both ends of every drawn flight were right, and
## the error was entirely in how long the ball took to get between them.
##
## Same keys as the level-ground solve so a call site changes only by gaining its
## two heights. `apex_height_meters` keeps that function's *relative rise*
## contract, because calibration reads it for the duration/rise invariant;
## `apex_absolute_meters` is the height above the floor, which is what a net
## clearance question wants.

## The flight of a ball whose speed and angle have already been decided.
##
## Nothing is solved here, which is the point. `solve_launch_arc` and
## `solve_struck_arc` both *derive* the force from a target -- "how hard must
## this be hit to land there" -- and that is the right question for a set or a
## serve, where the player is placing the ball. It is the wrong question for a
## spike: a hitter chooses how hard to swing and the ball goes where that swing
## sends it, which is the causal direction `GeometricAttackResolver` already
## resolves in and `BallFlightModel` was written for.
##
## Horizontal motion is uniform without drag, so the time is the ground distance
## over the horizontal component and needs no solve at all.
