## also shortened every serve by the depth of the service zone, so serve flight
## time, the receiver's reading angle and the reception's difficulty were all
## measured from a contact point that cannot occur.
##
## A metre back from the line is an ordinary standing-serve contact point. It is
## deliberately modest: the tactical board reserves a 34 px margin outside the

## The region of court each lane actually covers -- along the net and off it.
##
## `LANE_X` is one point per lane and was being used as though it were the lane
## itself: `lane_target` returned it, the setter aimed at it, and the only reason
## two attacks ever landed in different places was execution scatter around a
## constant. Measured over 300 rallies that produced four bands about 1.5 m wide
## with dead net between them, and a 3.1 m stretch where no ball was ever struck.
##
## Depth belongs here for the same reason x does. Holding one shared depth
## constant for every lane meant the pipe's four metres and a pin's half metre
## were the same field, so the only way to summarise contact depth was to pool
## lanes that have nothing to do with each other -- which is exactly what made
## the first tightness sweep unreadable. A zone owns both of its axes.
##
## `depth_m` is metres from the tape on the hitter's own side. Quicks live tight
## because that is what makes them quick; the pins have room to be set off the
## net; the pipe is a back-row ball and sits behind the attack line.
##
## Every range is centred on the constant it replaced -- 0.54 m for the front
## lanes, 4.00 m for the pipe -- so that with `ENABLE_HITTER_TIGHTNESS` off the
## engine behaves exactly as it did. Zone centres that quietly moved the base
## depth would make the flag one of two things changing behaviour, and then
## nothing measured against it means anything.
