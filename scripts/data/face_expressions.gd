class_name FaceExpressions
extends RefCounted

## Faces, built from the same primitives as the rest of the body.
##
## The alternative was a drawn texture on a quad in front of the head, which is
## cheaper and gives finer control -- and would have read as a sticker. Every
## other feature on these bodies is a box or a sphere sitting in space, so a
## painted face would have been the only flat thing on an actor made of solids.
## Small solids projected onto the head's surface curve with it and light with
## it, which is what makes the face belong to the head rather than sit on it.
##
## **A face is a pair, and the name is a lookup.** Three eye states and three
## mouth shapes, and the label is whatever that combination reads as. Nothing is
## authored per expression.
##
## The first version did it the other way round -- five named faces, each with
## its own hand-picked numbers -- and it produced a "happy" that everybody read
## as *devious*, because a smile under narrowed eyes is a scheme rather than a
## delight. With the name derived from the parts that cannot happen: narrowed
## eyes plus a smile *is* devious, and it is called that because of what it is
## made of rather than what it was meant to be.
##
## It also turns five faces into nine for no extra authoring, and every new eye
## state would add three more.

const NEUTRAL: String = "neutral"

## How open the eyes are, and how they tilt.
##
## Tilt belongs to the eye state rather than to the expression, which is the
## whole reason the grid works. Narrowed eyes tilt inner-end-down, and that one
## fact does three jobs at once: narrowed under a frown is *cross*, narrowed
## under a flat mouth is *suspicious*, and narrowed under a smile is *devious*.
## Wide eyes tilt slightly the other way, which reads as open under a smile and
## as concern under a frown. Flat eyes have no tilt to give.
const EYES := {
	"full": {"squash": 1.18, "tilt": 7.0},
	"half": {"squash": 0.66, "tilt": -20.0},
	"flat": {"squash": 0.26, "tilt": 0.0},
}

## `curve` is signed: positive lifts the corners above the centre.
##
## The flat mouth is the widest of the three on purpose. A straight line drawn
## right across the face is not a milder smile or a milder frown -- it is its own
## reading, and the width is what stops it looking like a curve that failed.
const MOUTHS := {
	"smile": {"curve": 1.00, "half_width": 0.34},
	"flat": {"curve": 0.00, "half_width": 0.42},
	"frown": {"curve": -0.85, "half_width": 0.28},
}

## eye state -> mouth shape -> what that combination reads as.
##
## The single source of truth for which expressions exist. Adding a row or a
## column adds faces without touching anything else.

	"full": {"smile": "happy", "flat": "neutral", "frown": "worried"},

## Where the features sit, in head-normalised coordinates: u across, v up, both
## on [-1, 1] against the head's own semi-axes. Authored this way so one set of
## numbers serves a 0.105-radius Stalk head and a 0.185-radius Feli head without
## a per-type table.
const EYE_U: float = 0.40
const EYE_V: float = 0.19
const MOUTH_V: float = -0.34
## How far the mouth's centre travels from its corners at full curve.
const MOUTH_BOW: float = 0.19
## How finely the mouth's curve is sampled.
##
## **Renamed from `MOUTH_SEGMENTS`, and half its old justification is retired.**
## It read: "Seven is where the curve stops reading as a staircase at roster
## distance; more costs mesh instances on every actor on court." The first half
## still holds and the second does not -- a sample is now a pair of vertices in
## one swept mesh rather than a whole `BoxMesh` with its own inverted-hull
## outline, so the budget that pinned this at seven is gone. Fifteen because the
## cost is now vertices, and because the curve it is approximating is tightest at
## the corners of a muzzle, which is exactly where seven was coarsest.
const MOUTH_SAMPLES: int = 15

## **More than half of every eye used to be its own outline.** A Feli eye is
## authored 0.053 m across and `_ink_node` grew a 0.030 m inverted hull on every
## side of it, so what actually showed was 0.113 m -- the geometry was a minority
## of the mark. Worse, the hull is a fixed distance in metres while the box scales
## with the head, so a small-headed voli's eyes were proportionally much larger
## than a big-headed one's: the exact thing the head-normalised units above exist
## to prevent, undone downstream by a constant nobody connected to it.
##
## The hull also had to go somewhere. Grown out of a mark that thin it burst
## through the surrounding head, and the dark fringes that produced around the
## eyes are the "speckles", "eye bags" and "dotted lines" reported on faces that
## should be plain. Vegi's, having no muzzle to distract from them, read as a
## moustache.
##
## Raised by a fifth rather than doubled, and the first attempt is the instructive
## one. Compensating for the hull's *full* growth -- 0.060 m across, which is 0.34
## in normalised units on a 0.178 m head -- produced eyes half again too big,
## because most of that growth went sideways *into* the skull and was occluded.
## What ever showed was the box plus a thin rim, and a thin rim is what this
## replaces. Measured against the ink-collapsed render rather than against the
## arithmetic.

## Lift off the surface, in head radii. Enough that a feature never z-fights with
## the skull it is sitting on.
const SURFACE_LIFT: float = 0.02
## A muzzle is a much smaller sphere than a skull, so it curves away far faster
## under the same mouth.
##
## **This was 0.13, and it was treating the symptom.** At the skull's lift the
## outer *segments* sank into the muzzle and the smile came out looking like
## gritted teeth -- a row of separate dark chips rather than one stroke. Lifting
## the whole row clear of the surface hid the gaps by floating the mouth in front
## of the snout, which is a different wrong picture and the one the user
## eventually reported.
##
## The mouth is now a single swept stroke that carries its own `depth`, so
## nothing can sink relative to anything else and there is no gap to hide. Back
## to the skull's own lift: a mouth sits on a muzzle the way it sits on a face.
const MUZZLE_LIFT: float = SURFACE_LIFT
## And the mouth has to sit nearer the muzzle's middle. `MOUTH_V` is authored for
## a face with a whole skull under it; carried straight onto a muzzle it lands on
## the bottom lip and falls off the curve.
const MUZZLE_V_COMPRESS: float = 0.50

## Whiskers: how many a side, how long against the muzzle's radius, how thick at
## the root, where on the snout they root, and how far they splay.
##
## Long, because a whisker that stops at the edge of the snout is a bristle. Half
## again the muzzle's radius puts the tips outside the head's silhouette, which is
## the whole point -- they break the outline, and an outline is what this rig is
## read by. Thin enough to be a line and no thinner: they carry no ink hull (a
## 30 mm hull on a 4 mm whisker is a black rod), so their own geometry is the
## stroke and it has to survive the quantiser at roster distance.
