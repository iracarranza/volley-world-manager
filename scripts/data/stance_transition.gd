extends RefCounted

## Getting into a stance, and getting out of one.
##
## Two things on this rig change a body instantly, and they are the same thing
## seen twice:
##
## - **`ready_stance` is read fresh every frame.** `match_court_3d.gd` assigns
##   it and `set_pose` reads `ReadyStance.joints(...)` on the next frame, so a
##   middle dropping off the net goes from hands-up to a defender's crouch
##   between two frames. Nothing tweens it because nothing holds the previous
##   one.
## - **A floor recovery ends by running out of phase.** `_recovery_clock` is a
##   *phase*, so the moment playback stops drawing a voli as the contact actor
##   the recovery stops advancing and the body snaps to whatever the gait says.
##   Photographed: `pose_recover_roll` at 0.86 is upright with the arms still
##   out sideways, and `pose_recover_knee` never rises at all -- its `down`
##   term is monotonic and has no counterpart.
##
## Both are "this body is not in the stance it should be in, and has to get
## there". So there is one mechanism, with two entry points that differ only in
## how long they take: a fifth of a second to change what you are ready for, a
## second to get off the floor.
##
## Pure and deterministic, like the other pose modules.

## ## How long
##
## **Derived from the distance between the two stances rather than tabulated.**
##
## A table of pair durations is nine numbers for three stances and sixteen for
## four, and every one of them is a thing to get wrong quietly. The distance
## between two joint sets is already the answer to "how much has to change", and
## it is a number this file can compute -- so adding a fourth stance gets a
## sensible duration without anybody choosing one.
##
## The distance is in degrees, summed over the joints that carry a stance, with
## the trunk converted so a radian of lean counts like the tens of degrees it
## actually is.
const STANCE_MIN_SECONDS: float = 0.14
const STANCE_MAX_SECONDS: float = 0.42
const STANCE_SECONDS_PER_DEGREE: float = 0.0022

## **Dropping into a stance is faster than coming out of one.**
##
## An athlete snaps into a defensive posture -- that is the whole point of the
## word "ready" -- and unwinds out of it lazily, because nothing is asking them
## to hurry. Applied as a scale on the duration rather than as a second table,
## and keyed on whether the *target* is the more loaded of the two, which the
## knee already says.
const LOADING_SCALE: float = 0.72
const UNLOADING_SCALE: float = 1.25

## How long it takes to get back on your feet, in seconds.
##
## **These are the simulator's own numbers**, not a second opinion about them.
## `RallySimulator.RECOVERY_DELAY_SECONDS` already prices what each state costs a
## defender before they are a defender again -- a knee is most of a contact, a
## fall is a contact and the transition after it, being blown away is the rest of
## the exchange -- and a drawn recovery that takes a different length of time
## than the priced one is a body that stands up before or after the rally says it
## did.
##
## Copied rather than imported because the dependency would run the wrong way: a
## pose module must not reach into the simulator. A suite check holds the two
## tables equal, which is the same device the codebase uses wherever a value has
## to live in two places.

	"knee": 0.55,
	"fall": 0.95,
	"blown_away": 1.35,

## The joints a stance is made of. Named so `distance` and `blend` cannot
## disagree about what they are walking, and so a stance that grows a joint gets
## it in both places at once.

	"hip_degrees", "knee_degrees", "abduction_degrees",
	"arm_degrees", "elbow_degrees",

## The trunk, kept separate because it is in radians and everything else is in
## degrees. Summing the two without this is how a lean worth 20 degrees counts
## as a third of one.

## How far apart two stances are, in degrees.
static func distance(from_joints: Dictionary, to_joints: Dictionary) -> float:

## The settle curve.
##
## Ease-out rather than ease-in-out: a body arriving in a stance decelerates
## into it, and the acceleration at the start already happened -- it is the
## decision that caused the change. An ease-in on the front of that reads as
## hesitation, which is the opposite of what a ready stance means.
##
## Named `settle` and not `ease`, because `ease` is a GDScript global taking two
## arguments and a static method that shadows it fails to parse at every call
## site *except* its own file.

	return 1.0 - pow(1.0 - t, 2.4)


## One stance partway into another.
##
## Returns a joint set of the same shape, so the caller hands it to
## `GaitBiomechanics.resolve` exactly where it used to hand a named stance. That
## is the whole reason this is a blend of *stances* rather than a blend of the
## posed rig: the gait interpolates out of its ready stance already, and a
## transition that fought it further down would be two systems moving the same
## joints.

	from_joints: Dictionary, to_joints: Dictionary, progress: float
) -> Dictionary:
	var t := settle(progress)
	var out := {}
