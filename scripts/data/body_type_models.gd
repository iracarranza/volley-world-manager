## What each body type looks like, as data.
##
## `PlayerActor3D` was one hand-built rig: a capsule torso, a sphere head, four
## cylinders, and every attachment point written into `set_pose()` as a literal
## -- `left_arm.position = Vector3(-0.40, 1.52, 0.0)`. Six body types already
## existed in generation, carrying real height, mass and attribute deltas, and
## all six drew as that same capsule. A Feli and an Ursi differed in the
## simulation and were indistinguishable on the court.
##
## The rig cannot simply be swapped per type, because those literals only fit
## the proportions they were written for: a taller torso needs its shoulders
## higher or the arms grow out of its chest. So the attachment points move into
## the silhouette alongside the meshes, and `set_pose()` reads them. Posing then
## works for any body plan that can name a shoulder, a hip and a head.
##
## All six types are modelled. `Vegi` replaces `Homi` -- there is no human in
## this world, and the default body being "the normal one" was the only thing
## making the other five read as costumes. Vegi is now the no-lean body the way
## Landavol is the no-lean region: it exists so "unremarkable" has a home instead
## of every type needing an identity.
##
## The three animal types are told apart at the **ear** before anything else,
## because ears survive a silhouette when a torso profile does not: Feli pricks
## up, Cani drops, Ursi is round and set high, Simi is a flat disc on the side of
## the head. Everything below that -- limb thickness, leg length, where the mass
## sits -- is the second read.

## Body types with a silhouette of their own. Anything else falls back.
const MODELLED: Array[String] = ["Vegi", "Feli", "Avi", "Cani", "Ursi", "Simi"]

const FALLBACK_TYPE: String = "Vegi"

## The shapes a Vegi grows in.
##
## These names are internal and stay internal. A Vegi is not "a Tomato" and is
## never labelled as one anywhere a player can read -- they are all just Vegi,
## and the produce is how the variety is generated rather than what the variety
## *is*. Surfacing the name turns a body into a species and invites a taxonomy
## nobody asked for; keeping it internal leaves a roster of Vegi who happen to
## look unlike each other, which is the intent.
##
## Fixed per player for their whole career, because a body you recognise across
## seasons is the point of drawing bodies at all.
##
## Six, with deliberately unlike silhouettes -- squat, tall, wide, waisted,
## rooted and stalky -- so one Vegi reads as a different Vegi at a glance from
## across the court rather than needing the colour to carry it.
## Five, and the count went *down* on purpose.
##
## Pumpkin and Turnip were both "a heavy round mass", which is the silhouette
## Ursi already owns outright and owns better -- a Vegi competing with a body
## type for the same read is a Vegi doing nothing. Pear is already the massive
## one among the produce and needs no help. Pepper takes their slot as the
## lobed, square-shouldered shape none of the others reach, and it is the reason
## palettes exist: a bell pepper is the one produce whose *colour* is the first
## thing anybody names about it.

	## times), skin-coloured rather than crown, and set close enough to the axis
	## that adjacent lobes overlap -- centres 0.219 apart with radii of 0.215

## Colourways, per body.

## Two volis of the same body type used to be the same colour, which meant the

## is: it costs no geometry, survives any distance the game is watched from, and
## it is the first thing anybody describes a teammate by.
##
## Bell peppers are why this exists. A pepper's colour is the first thing anybody
## names about it, so the produce that most needed variants is the one that made
## it obvious every body needed them.
##
## Deterministic per voli and fixed for their career, like the produce. `crown`
## is the secondary -- leaves, beak, ears, muzzle -- and it is chosen with the
## skin rather than separately, because the pairing is the palette.

## A mark that lies **on** a body rather than a box standing in front of one.
##
## **Why this exists, since the previous three attempts each sounded sufficient.**
## A kit mark used to be a stack of `BoxMesh` segments, each one flat, each one
## placed at the radius its own height gave it. Through the barrel of a torso
## that is fine, because the radius does not change. Through the caps it is not:
## a capsule of radius 0.308 loses about 10 mm of radius between one segment of a
## 0.52 m panel and the next, while the panel is only 12 mm deep. Every joint
## between two segments was therefore a step nearly as tall as the mark was
## thick, and every step showed its own horizontal top face -- lit from above by
## the key, which is why they read as bright dashes scattered through the *upper*
## half of a panel and not the lower, and why the outline stepped instead of
## curving. Three repairs missed it because all three assumed the defect was in
## how the boxes were *seated* rather than in their being boxes at all: removing
## the 6% segment overlap, ruling out coplanar z-fighting, and anchoring the
## inner face instead of the centre each changed nothing measurable, and the
## per-segment dump showed the geometry was doing exactly what it was told.
##
## A box cannot follow a curve. So a mark is now a **patch**: a tessellated shell
## whose vertices are evaluated on the body's own profile, extruded `depth`
## outward and `PATCH_BITE` inward. It curves because its vertices curve.
##
## Three things the box stack could not do fall out of this for free -- a mark
## wider than the flat of the body no longer floats at its edges, a tapering
## stroke tapers continuously rather than in steps, and a rolled stroke shears
## along the surface instead of tilting a slab off it.
##
## `rows` runs top to bottom, each entry `{y, radius, u, half}`: the height, the
## body's radius there, the arc-centre of the mark and its half-width, both in
## metres of arc. `reference_radius` converts arc to angle and is held constant
## down the mark, because a vertical line on a body is a line of constant
## longitude -- deriving the angle per row instead is what splayed Blôc's
## outermost stripe from 50 degrees at its middle to 60 at its ends.

## One quad, wound so its front face points away from the body.
##
## The back of a shirt is the same construction reflected, and reflection
## reverses handedness -- so a winding that faces outward on the chest faces
## *into* the body on the back. Flipping here rather than at every call site is
## the difference between one rule and sixteen chances to get it wrong.
## A single stroke laid along a curve on a body, instead of a row of chips.
##
## **The same defect `build_surface_patch` above was written for, one face
## further in.** A mouth was seven axis-aligned `BoxMesh` segments placed along a
## parabola and never rotated, which on a skull is survivable and on a muzzle is
## not: a 0.10 m snout curves away far faster than a 0.185 m head, so toward the
## corners each box left the surface at a different depth and the stroke opened
## into a row of separate dark chips. It looked like bared teeth, and the
## measured repair at the time was to raise `MUZZLE_LIFT` to 0.13 -- which does
## not close the gaps, it floats the whole row in front of the snout.
##
## The other half was invisible and worse. `PlayerActor3D._ink_node` gives every
## mesh its own inverted hull, so seven boxes carried **seven independent 30 mm
## black outlines**, which is what actually drew the chips. One mesh has one
## outline, and `BACKLOG.md`'s open note on roster-distance line noise -- "two
## outlines at slightly different offsets is most of the noise" -- gets seven
## fewer of them per face.
##
## `points` is the centreline already projected onto the body, `normals` the
## outward surface normal at each. The ribbon is framed per sample from those two,
## so it shears along the surface the way `build_surface_patch` does rather than
## tilting a slab off it; `thickness` is the half-width across the stroke and
## `depth` how far it stands proud, both in metres.
## A snout: a box that tapers toward its front face.
##
## **The angular jaw is the point, not a side effect.** A sphere muzzle gives a
## round bulge with no jawline at all, and the study's prism gave a straight jaw
## meeting a corner -- which reads as a snout on a body drawn entirely from flat
## planes, and which is what was chosen. Eight vertices, front face smaller than
## the back, so the taper is the whole shape.
##
## Sized from `half_width` and `half_height` -- the same envelope a sphere muzzle
## published as `radius` and `height * 0.5` -- because `PlayerActor3D._mouth_override`
## and `_featured_muzzle` both read a muzzle's size by those names and would
## otherwise have to learn a second vocabulary for the same quantity.
## **Width and height taper independently, and collapsing them was wrong.** A
## single ratio makes the front pad a scale model of the back, which is a cone
## with corners; a snout narrows faster across than it does top-to-bottom, and
## that difference is the jawline. The study this shape was taken from used
## 0.64 across against 0.71 down on the same muzzle.

## two Tomatoes on the same colourway were the same voli. Sports games solve this
## with faces -- hair, features, eye colour -- and these are vegetables and
## animals, so what they have instead is **coat**: how a body is patterned, which
## is the thing that actually distinguishes one tabby from another cat.
##
## Weighted by repetition rather than by a number beside each name. A list read
## with one index is a table anybody can check by counting, and the alternative
## -- a dictionary of floats summing to one -- is a thing to get wrong silently.
##
## `none` is in every list and is the most common single entry everywhere. A
## marking that every voli has is not a marking, it is a species trait; the
## unmarked ones are what make a marked one worth noticing.

## What a voli's *body* is, beyond its species.
##
## Colour and coat gave the animals ten colourways and five coats, which is a lot
## of looks and still only two axes -- and both of them are paint. A Vegi reads as
## an individual across a squad because its **shape** varies: a Pear is not a
## Stalk from any distance. The animals had exactly one shape per species, so two
## Cani on the same colourway with the same coat were the same drawing twice.
##
## These are the shape axes the animals were missing. Three of them, hashed off
## three separate strings for the same reason `marks:` is separate from
## `palette:` -- an ear length that correlated with a colourway would be a fourth
## way of saying the third one.
##
## Weighted by repetition, like `MARKINGS`, and for the same reason: `standard`
## is the plurality of every axis, so most volis carry one or two notes rather
## than three and about a fifth are plain on all three. A feature every voli has
## is not a feature. Twenty-seven distinct shapes per family, on top of the ten
## colourways and the coats.
##
## Five entries, and the count matters -- see `feature_for`, which is where the
## rest of this is recorded. These were authored as four-entry lists drawn the
## way every other axis here is drawn, and the three came out perfectly
## correlated: every small-eared voli was also short-muzzled and also heavy,
## three names for one axis.

}

## Which families have a face built out of parts these axes can reach.
##
## Vegi's head is produce and Avi's is a beak and crest, so neither has an ear or
## a muzzle to vary; they are held back until their own axes are authored rather
## than given a silently-inert entry in the table above. The other four all carry
## a named `EarLeft`/`EarRight` pair and a `Muzzle`, which is all these axes ask
## for -- though not all in the same geometry, which is what `_featured_ear` is
## about.
const FEATURED_BODIES: Array[String] = ["Feli", "Cani", "Ursi", "Simi"]

## Ear size, and how the pair sits off the skull.
##
## Four keys because there are two ear geometries in the roster and one set of
## multipliers cannot serve both honestly. Feli and Cani wear **cones**, where
## length and base width are independent and the pair's carriage is a rotation;
## Ursi and Simi wear **spheres**, where a round ear that grows taller without
## growing wider stops being a round ear, so a single `size` drives both and the
## carriage is how far apart they sit.
##
## `splay` is added to the **magnitude** of the authored z rotation, keeping its
## sign, which is what stops this axis erasing the difference between the cone
## families. Feli's ears stand at 14 degrees and Cani's hang at 152; a longer ear
## is 19 and 157 respectively -- more cat and more hound, never the other one.
## `spread` is the sphere families' equivalent: a bear's ears being wide-set or
## close-set is the readable half of that silhouette.

##
## Expressed as radius, height and position rather than as an instance `scale`,

##
## Written the usual way -- `hash("ears:%d")`, `hash("muzzle:%d")`,
## `hash("build:%d")` -- the three axes came out perfectly correlated: over 4,000
## ids they drew 4 of the 27 shapes they can express, every small-eared voli also
## short-muzzled and also heavy. Per-axis counts looked perfect, which is what
## made it worth measuring the *joint* distribution instead: an axis moving in
## lockstep with another is still individually well distributed, so the obvious
## instrument cannot see this at all.
##
## Godot's `String.hash` is djb2, `h = 33 * h + c`, so a string built as
## prefix-then-id hashes to `H(prefix) * 33^m + S(id)` where `m` is the id's
## length. Two axes sharing an id therefore differ by `(H_a - H_b) * 33^m` -- a
## value that does not depend on the id at all. **A constant offset, at every
## modulus.** Changing the list size cannot help; five entries drew 4 of 27 the
## same as four did.
##
## Putting the id first makes the axis word the suffix, and the three words are
## different lengths, so the id is multiplied by a different power of 33 in each
## and the offset stops being constant. That still needs a non-power-of-two
## table, because 33 is congruent to 1 modulo any power of two and those
## differing powers collapse back to equal -- which is the second half of the
## same bug, and why `FEATURE_AXES` has five entries rather than four.
##
## `probe_feature_independence.gd` keeps both broken forms alongside this one and
## fails below 27 of 27. The older axes here -- `marks:`, `palette:`, `vegi:` --
## are all prefix-then-id and so are all constant offsets of each other; they
## read as independent only because 5, 6, 7 and 10 are pairwise coprime enough
## that the residues spread. That is luck, not design, and it is the thing to

## (cos near +1) so a longer one grows *upward* from a fixed skull join; Cani's
## hang past horizontal (cos near -0.9) so the same term grows the ear *downward*

## caught the key light, so the one thing on the face that reads was a bright

##
## A nose is wide, low and mostly *in* the snout. Wider than half the muzzle so

## a dome and not a ball; high on the snout where a muzzle's own profile is
## broadest; and sunk far enough that its silhouette merges with the snout
## instead of sitting on it. It also takes the body's lighter pen -- the crown
## weight exists for a part that carries a type's identity at thumbnail size, and
## this one is read at conversational distance if at all.
## **Measured against the pad it sits on, not the muzzle's widest section.** It
## was 0.46 of the back half-width, which on a strongly tapered snout is most of
## the front face: Feli's nose came out 0.72 of its own pad's half-width and
## pinched the face shut, reading as small-featured rather than as small-nosed.
## Cani carried the identical ratio and showed it far less, because a longer
## snout has more surface either side of the nose for the eye to land on.
##

## The crown-coloured mark on a skin-coloured snout.
##
## **Why the muzzle stopped being crown-coloured, and why this replaces it.**
## All four muzzled types authored the whole snout as `crown`, which on Feli is
## `f0dcc0` against a `c98f4e` head -- a near-white patch with a hard edge across
## the middle of a tan face. It read as a mask rather than as a snout, and it
## made the mouth worse in two directions at once: the mouth's ink colour is
## chosen from *skin* luminance, so Feli's dark stroke sat on near-white and read
## as a bared row, while Ursi's dark `4a3b34` skin selects the *light* stroke and
## put a pale mouth on a pale muzzle where it nearly vanished. Colouring the
## muzzle `skin` gives the mouth the same contrast against the snout that it has
## against the head, on every type.
##
## The two-tone reading `crown` was there for survives as a nose, which is the
## place a real muzzle is actually a different colour.
##
## **Derived here rather than authored four times.** `_featured_muzzle` scales a
## muzzle by `MUZZLE_FEATURES` and slides it along -z, so a nose with an absolute
## position would sit correctly on a standard muzzle and float off a short or a
## long one. Reading the muzzle *after* the feature axis has run makes one rule
## serve four types and follow the axis for nothing -- the same choice
## `PlayerActor3D._mouth_override` makes, and for the reason it states: a second
## copy of these numbers would be a constant wearing the muzzle's name.
##
## Size stays in `radius`/`height`/`position` and never in an instance `scale`,
## which is the constraint `MUZZLE_FEATURES` states above and which exists

## Close the gap between the torso and the head, whatever the blend left there.
##
## `_toward_universal` pulls `head_y` toward the shared figure but leaves the
## torso where the type authored it, so the two move apart by however far that
## type disagreed with the reference. On the round produce that is most of a
## head's height, and a head hanging clear of the shoulders reads as broken
## rather than as long-necked.
##
## Fixing it by re-authoring every `head_y` would be a set of constants tuned
## against the blend -- correct until the blend moves, and silently wrong after.
## A neck sized from the two things it spans is correct by construction, and it
## is also just a real part of a body.
## The four joints the rig already turns on but has never drawn.
##
## `player_actor_3d.tscn` gives every limb two capsule segments meeting at a
## pivot: `LeftArm`'s own origin is the shoulder, `LeftArm/Elbow` is the elbow,
## and the leg is built the same way at the hip and the knee. The pivots bend
## correctly and carry no geometry, so a limb is two tapered capsules whose ends
## simply stop next to each other -- which is what makes an arm read as stacked
## sausages rather than as an arm.
##
## This is the same repair `_add_neck` below already makes at the one junction
## somebody noticed: "a short collar of neck at the join is what stops a sphere
## head reading as balanced on a sphere body". The other four junctions have the
## same problem and never got the same treatment.
##
## **It is not the unified-mesh work**, and the distinction is worth keeping. A
## smooth-union body is one continuous surface with no seams anywhere and one
## outline around the whole of it; this is eight spheres parked on pivots that
## already exist. It buys most of the same read for a fraction of the cost, and
## it leaves every mesh, material and ink hull where they are.
##
## Each sphere is sized from the limb radii that actually meet at that joint, so
## a heavy voli's elbow is a heavy voli's elbow without anything being restated.
## Slightly proud of both -- a joint that merely matches its limbs leaves the
## seam exactly where it was.
## A `static var`, like `type_expression`, because the first
## value tried reads as a knuckle rather than as a joint and the difference
## between "filled" and "doll-jointed" is one number nobody should have to argue
## about without looking at both.
## The kit, as garments rather than as paint.
##
## A voli's clothing has been two things: the torso capsule painted the club's
## colour, and a section of that same capsule painted darker for shorts. Nothing
## is *worn* -- the body is simply a different colour below the neck, which is
## why the silhouette says "primitive" no matter how it is lit. Miis and clay
## figures read as dressed because the garment is a **shell with edges**: a
## sleeve that ends partway down the arm, a short leg that ends above the knee,
## a hem you can see.
##
## These are the two edges that do the most work, and both are cheap: they hang
## off limb bones that already exist, so they travel with every pose, and they
## take the `kit` colour key, so a club's strip dresses them with no new plumbing.
##
## The shorts legs also fix the defect that prompted this. The shorts are a
## section of the torso's profile, so from the front their silhouette is a
## trapezoid and each thigh crosses its lower corner -- a leg passing through the
## *side* of a garment rather than out of the bottom of it. A short kit-coloured
## sleeve around the top of each thigh is what a pair of shorts actually is, and
## the corner stops being a place a leg comes out of.
## The radius to build a garment from, so its narrow end clears what it covers.
##
## `narrow` is the multiplier the garment's tightest end already uses. Returning
## a *base* rather than a finished radius is what keeps the flare: the caller
## applies both of its own multipliers to this, so a shell that was 1.30 at the
## cuff and 1.34 at the hem stays 1.30 and 1.34 of something slightly larger,
## rather than being lifted at one end and pinched at the other.
##
## **The standoff is one line width, and that is a derivation rather than a
## taste.** A garment sitting exactly `body_ink_metres` off the limb sits *on*
## the limb's outline -- two coincident parallel surfaces with no depth bias, a
## per-pixel coin flip, and the dash that prompted this. The only non-arbitrary
## distance available is the thickness of the line being cleared, so the garment
## stands one line clear of it.
##
## The `maxf` does not currently bind on any body, and that is worth stating
## rather than implying otherwise: it lifts whenever the limb is thinner than
## `2 * body_ink_metres / (narrow - 1)`, which is 0.12 m for a sleeve, and the
## widest arm in the roster is Ursi's at 0.081. Every body grows. It is kept
## because it is the correct floor, not because it is currently doing anything.

## are wide and set *low*; and the head is small and sits close to them with
## almost no neck. Nothing about the standing silhouette is upright-human, and
## none of it needs a costume to say so. The flat side-discs went with it -- ears
## in a human's place on a human's head was half the problem.
