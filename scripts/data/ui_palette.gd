	## The court, softened.
	##
	## `d97a45` is a saturated terracotta, and a volleyball court is the single
	## largest field of colour on the screen -- roughly a third of the frame. A
	## hue that reads as warm on a swatch reads as loud across that much area,
	## which is the ordinary trap of picking a colour in isolation and then
	## applying it to a wall.
	##
	## So the same hue, taken down in saturation and up a little in value: it is
	## still unmistakably a warm indoor court and it no longer competes with the
	## bodies standing on it, which are the thing a viewer is supposed to be
	## reading. The lines stay near-white and gain contrast for free.
	##
	## `court_floor` comes up off near-black for the matching reason. At `101b27`
	## the surround was a void the court floated in; a room has a floor, and it
	## being visible is most of what stops a lit court reading as a product on a
	## turntable.

## What a grade is written in.
##
## Two tables, and it has to be two. These are the only colours in the interface
## that are *data* rather than decoration -- the number says what it is by what
## it is written in -- so they cannot be theme tokens, and for a long time they
## were one table used in both themes on the reasoning that a grade means the
## same thing on either page.
##
## Which is true of the meaning and false of the pigment. The dark table is five
## bright inks for a dark page, and C is `f2f4f7` -- as near white as makes no
## difference. Put that on cream paper and the most common grade on the roster,
## the one every average attribute carries, is invisible. Not hard to read:
## absent. A player's whole middle band read as a column of blank space.
##
## So the light table is the same five *hues* taken down to values that survive
## being written on paper, and C stops being "no colour" and becomes the page's
## own muted ink -- which is what average should look like anyway.
