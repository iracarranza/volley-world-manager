## A serve as a whole action, from the toss to the step into the court.
##
## What it replaces was two lines: one shoulder angle ramping to full extension
## and one elbow opening under it, both saturating at `-0.20` and then holding
## for the entire outgoing flight. Read on the sheet that is a server who cocks,
## swings, and then stands frozen with their arm above their head while the ball
## crosses the net -- no follow-through, no weight transfer, no toss arm coming
## down, and no legs at all. It is the same defect the spike and the block each
## had, and it is worth naming once more: **a contact drawn only up to the ball
## is half an action**, and the missing half is the half that tells a viewer what
## just happened.
##
## ## What a serve actually is
##
## Stand, toss, load, swing, contact, follow through, step in. The toss is the
## part servers practise most and the part a drawn serve most obviously lacks:
## the guide arm lifts the ball and *stays up* while the hitting arm goes back,
## and it comes down through the contact rather than before it.
##
## The load is a wind-up in three axes at once, and leaving any of them out is
## what makes an arm read as a hinge. The shoulder draws **back**, the elbow
## carries **out** away from the ribs, and the trunk arches and turns away from
## the target. The swing is those three unwinding in the reverse order they were
## wound: legs, trunk, shoulder, elbow -- the elbow last, which is where the whip
## comes from.
##
## The follow-through is not decoration. A serving arm does not stop overhead; it
## sweeps down and **across** to the opposite hip while the trunk keeps rotating
## and the weight arrives on the front foot. A server drawn without it looks like
## someone waving.
##
## ## The shoulder path is one continuous sweep
##
## Rotating an arm about x by `a` puts its direction at `(up, back) = (-cos a,
## -sin a)`, so **decreasing** `a` from zero carries a hanging arm backward, then
## up behind the head, then over the top and forward, then down in front:
##
##       0   hanging
##     -90   straight back, horizontal
##    -160   cocked: up and behind the head
##    -190   contact: overhead, a little in front
##    -250   forward and still high
##    -300   forward and below the shoulder
##    -352   hanging again, a shade in front
##
## Every stage below moves along that one line in one direction, which is why the
## arm never doubles back through the body to reach the next pose. Ending at -352
## rather than +8 is the whole trick: the two are the same arm and only one of
## them is reachable without unwinding the entire swing backwards.
##
## ## Phase convention
##
## Signed, contact at 0, matching `SpikeBiomechanics` and `BlockBiomechanics`:
##
##   -1.0  standing behind the line, ball in both hands
##    0.0  the hand is on the ball
##   +1.0  recovered, stepping onto the court
##
## Pure and deterministic, for the same reason as the other pose modules: a
## function of phase alone is one the suite can check without a scene.

## Where each stage begins on the signed timeline.
##
## The toss occupies most of the wind-up because that is where the time actually
## goes -- a served ball hangs -- and the swing is brief, which is why a serve
## looks sudden even though the action is not.
