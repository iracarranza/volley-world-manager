## A spike as a sequence of segments, not a single sweep.
##
## The attack pose used to interpolate one `swing` value: the shoulder rotated
## at a constant rate, the elbow opened at a constant rate, the legs held a fixed
## stride for the entire action and the torso held a fixed lean. Everything moved
## together and nothing moved first, which is what a windmill looks like and what
## a spike does not.
##
## What separates them is **proximal-to-distal sequencing**. A hitter drives from
## the floor and each segment peaks after the one inside it: knees extend, then
## the hips and trunk, then the shoulder, then the elbow, and the hand arrives
## last and fastest. Every segment is still travelling when the next one starts,
## so the body reads as a chain being cracked rather than a diagram rotating.
## That ordering is the whole of the visual difference, and it is why this is a
## table of staggered windows rather than a curve.
##
## Deliberately pure and deterministic: phase in, angles out, no state and no
## randomness. It is the only way pose work can be checked without eyes on a
## screen, and the suite does check it.
##
## ## Phase convention
##
## `phase` is signed and **contact is at 0**.
##
##   -1.0  the plant begins -- the hitter is still on the floor, arms behind
##    0.0  the hand meets the ball, at the top of the jump
##   +1.0  the landing has been absorbed
##
## The negative half is spent during the *set's* flight and the positive half
## during the attack's own, which is why playback needs a phase that spans two
## event windows rather than restarting in each. Before this, both halves ran
## 0 to 1 independently: the swing played out completely during the approach and
## then snapped back to fully cocked at the instant of contact and played again.

## Visual vocabulary semantics
##
## This is the clean, fully committed overhead attack base: plant and takeoff,
## high-elbow preparation, proximal-to-distal contact, follow-through, landing,
## and recovery. It assumes comfortable ideal striking geometry. Soft-shot and
## compromised/reaching families preserve this continuous chain and modify its
## late intention or body response rather than replacing the approach or launch.

## Where each phase of the spike begins, on the signed timeline above.
##
## Chosen against the real proportions of the action rather than spaced evenly.
## The plant and takeoff take most of the wind-up. The shoulder drive begins
## while the high elbow is still forming, then the elbow releases later. This
## overlap is quick without reducing the visible swing to a two-frame punch.

## Narrow on purpose: it is a label for the instant, not a phase with a duration.
const CONTACT_BAND: float = 0.04

## When the shoulder starts driving at the ball, and when the elbow follows.
##
## The shoulder starts before the named cock has finished and the elbow follows.
## The former -0.105/-0.09 windows compressed each into roughly two frames on
## the resolved takeoff clock. These wider windows publish a readable chain, and
## the Hermite contact velocity keeps that chain moving through phase zero.

## How high the guide arm reaches at the cock.
##
## 84 degrees is very nearly horizontal on this rig, and measured on the body it
## put the guide hand **0.10 m above the shoulder** -- out in front at chest
## height, where a hitter's non-hitting arm is doing nothing anybody can see.
## Reported as exactly that: the guide arm does not really do anything.
##
## The ball is above and in front. A guide arm that points at it has to be up
## there too, and the pull down from up there is what rotates the trunk. The
## value is chosen by where the hand lands rather than by what the angle sounds
## like; `tools/measure_spike_swing.gd` prints it.
const GUIDE_REACH_DEGREES: float = 132.0

## When the swing arm starts returning to a neutral hang.
##
## Well after `FOLLOW_END`, because the follow-through does not stop when the
## legs land. Set here rather than reusing `FOLLOW_END` so the two can be tuned
## apart -- they are different events happening to different limbs.
const ARM_RECOVER_START: float = FOLLOW_END

## Where the approach leaves both arms, which is where this model has to pick
## them up.
##
## **Taken from `ApproachBiomechanics` rather than restated.** It was restated,
## as +42, and the approach ends at -74: opposite signs for the same instant.
## `PlayerActor3D` hands off from the approach to this model at `PLANT_END`, so
## every spike in the game swung both arms back through the run-up and then
## snapped them 101 degrees forward to a neutral hang on the first frame of the
## plant, and lifted from there. Measured on the rig, the striking hand jumps
## 1.15 m across that one seam -- 18.7 m/s, the fastest the hand moves in the
## entire action, in the wrong direction, before the swing has started.
##
## That is the reported "the arm load just looks like the arm raising up rather
## than swinging up and forward": the load *was* being drawn, by the approach,
## and then discarded.
##
## Two numbers that must agree, so there is now one number. See
## `_test_spike_biomechanics_sequence`, which asserts the seam rather than
## asserting a value at phase -1 that playback never reaches.

const BACKSWING_ELBOW_DEGREES: float = ApproachBiomechanics.ARM_ELBOW_BACK_DEGREES

## The striking shoulder through the action. Negative carries the arm up and
## over: -180 is straight overhead, so -204 at contact is just forward of
## vertical, which is where a hitter actually meets the ball, and -252 is the
## arm continuing down across the body.
const SHOULDER_LIFT_DEGREES: float = -124.0
## The cock is a **high elbow**, not a raised arm.
##
## It was -152, which carries the upper arm to 62 degrees above horizontal --
## nearly overhead -- and with the elbow folded from there the forearm had nowhere
## to go but down and behind. Measured on the rig, that pair put the elbow 0.34 m
## above the shoulder and the hand 0.15 m above it and 0.31 m behind: the hand
## *below* its own elbow, hanging backward. A hitter never loads there.
##
## At -128 the elbow sits 0.25 m up and 0.29 m back -- pulled behind the shoulder
## line and above it, which is where the tension actually is -- and the forearm
## can then stand up out of it. The power comes from the shoulder pivoting forward
## and the forearm extending, so the load has to leave both of those with somewhere
## to travel.
const SHOULDER_COCK_DEGREES: float = -122.0
const SHOULDER_CONTACT_DEGREES: float = -204.0
const SHOULDER_FOLLOW_DEGREES: float = -252.0

## The elbow is what makes the arm a whip rather than a stick. It stays folded
## deep into the cock and opens *through* contact, one beat behind the shoulder.
##
## **Negative, and the sign was measured rather than reasoned.** The comment on
## `_set_elbow` says positive folds the forearm forward, and with the upper arm
## already tipped past vertical at the old cock that sent the hand backward and
## down instead. Sampling the rig's own node positions settles it: negative
## carries the hand forward and up out of the elbow, which is the direction a
## cocked arm actually folds.
##
## **A fold the head is not inside.** At -46 the forearm finished within a couple
## of degrees of vertical against a shoulder already up and back, so the two
## segments were near enough collinear to read as one straight thing. At -90 they
## made a chevron -- and the chevron folded the forearm *across the head*, which
## reads worse than a straight arm because the one segment that should be
## unmistakable is the one hidden behind a skull.
##
## -64 against a -122 shoulder puts the upper arm nearer horizontal and behind,
## and stands the forearm up out of it: measured, the elbow sits 0.26 m behind the
## shoulder and the hand another 0.23 m behind that and 0.47 m up, so the forearm
## is *above* the upper arm and clear of the head rather than crossing it. Still a
## real bend -- 64 degrees is a bend anyone would draw -- and still folding
## forward-and-up out of the joint, which was the previous correction and is not
## being undone.
const ELBOW_COCK_DEGREES: float = -64.0

## **The arm is not in one plane, and that was the whole thing missing.**
##
## Every angle above rotates about x, so the entire swing happened in the sagittal
## plane -- elbow straight back, forearm straight up, hand straight over. A hitter
## does not load like that. The elbow goes back *and out*, and the forearm rises
## up *and out* of it, which is what puts the hand where a hitter can see it and
## what makes the shape read as a bow rather than as a hinge.
##
## Abduction is that second axis: a roll on the shoulder, outward at the cock and
## unwound through the ball. It is deliberately not zero at contact either -- the
## arm comes over the top rather than through the centreline, and a hitter's
## contact is still a little outside their own shoulder.
##
## Signed by handedness like the trunk twist, so a left-hander loads outward on
## their own side rather than across their body.

## A window that **arrives at speed**: fastest at its end.
##
## `window` eases out, which is right for a segment settling into a position and
## exactly wrong for the one that hits the ball. Measured on the rig, the
## striking hand moved 5.0 m/s a tenth of a phase before contact, **1.0 m/s at
## contact** and 0.5 m/s just after -- the slowest part of the whole action was
## the instant the ball was struck, and the fastest was the backswing. That is
## the reported "the contact is still not snappy/explosive enough", and it was
## not a matter of magnitude: every angle was already correct at contact, and the
## arm had simply stopped by the time it got there.
##
## The cause was a correction that was right about pose and wrong about velocity.
## The shoulder's drive was deliberately ended at -0.03 and the elbow's at -0.02
## so that "a hitter is at full extension when the hand meets the ball" -- true,
## but a smoothstep reaches its end with zero slope, so full extension arrived
## *and stopped* three hundredths early. A hitter reaches full extension **at**
