## The three-step approach: the footwork that turns a run into a jump.
##
## `SpikeBiomechanics` starts at `PLANT_END`, phase -0.62, with both feet already
## down and the arms already back. Everything before that -- the part a hitter
## spends most of the action doing, and the part a viewer watches to know whether
## a swing is going to be any good -- was the ordinary running gait, so every
## attacker in the game jogged to the net and then teleported into a plant.
##
## ## Why three steps and not a run
##
## An approach is not locomotion with a jump on the end. It is a deceleration:
## the hitter arrives with horizontal speed they do not want and converts it into
## vertical speed they do, and the three steps are the mechanism.
##
##   **Directional** -- a short step that sets the line to the ball. Small,
##   because its job is aim rather than pace, and it is the step a hitter cuts
##   when the set is fast.
##
##   **Penultimate** -- the long one, and the whole point of the approach. The
##   foot reaches well out in front of the hips and the body stays low behind it,
##   which is what lets the leg act as a brake. A hitter whose penultimate is
##   short has nothing to convert and jumps off their calves.
##
##   **Close** -- the trail foot arrives beside the lead one and both plant
##   together. Feet square, knees deepest, and the arms -- which have been
##   swinging back through the last two steps -- are behind the hips and ready to
##   throw upward.
##
## ## Handedness
##
## A right-handed hitter closes **right then left**: the right foot takes the
## long penultimate step and the left closes beside it, which is what turns the
## shoulders slightly away from the net and loads the swing. A left-hander
## mirrors it exactly. That is why `lead_is_left` is the only handedness input --
## everything else falls out of which foot is doing which job.
##
## Pure and deterministic, like `SpikeBiomechanics` and `GaitBiomechanics`, and
## for the same reason: pose work that cannot be checked without eyes on a screen
## does not get checked.

## Where each step owns the approach window, as a share of it. The directional
## step is short and the last two are where the time goes -- a real approach is
## mostly its penultimate and its close, and rendering them at even thirds is the
## single fastest way to make an approach look like jogging.

## How far each foot swings, in degrees of hip. The penultimate is nearly double
## the directional, which is the proportion that makes it read as a *reach*
## rather than as another stride.

## And where the trail leg is while the lead reaches: extended behind, because
## the hitter is still travelling and has not caught up with their own foot yet.
const TRAIL_EXTENSION_DEGREES: float = -26.0

## Knee fold through the approach: gathering on the directional step, deep behind
## the penultimate, deepest at the close. The last of these is what
## `SpikeBiomechanics.KNEE_LOAD_DEGREES` (-58) picks up, so the two meet without
## a step in the curve.

## The arms. They run with the legs, then stop counter-swinging and go back
## together -- the moment they do is the clearest signal in the whole action that
## a jump is coming, and it is the one thing a viewer can read at a distance.

## Where the arms give up the run and start the backswing together. Inside the
## penultimate step, not at the close: by the time both feet land the arms are
## already behind, which is the whole timing of a jump.
const ARM_GATHER_START: float = 0.42

## Trunk. Upright on the approach, then folding forward over the penultimate as
## the hips sit back behind the braking foot. Negative is forward on this rig,
## matching `SpikeBiomechanics.TORSO_PLANT_RADIANS` at -0.26, which this hands
## off to.

## Every joint of the approach, for one instant of it.
##
## `progress` runs 0 at the first directional step to 1 at the plant, so callers
## remap whatever phase window they have onto it and this stays free of any
## particular pose's timing.
