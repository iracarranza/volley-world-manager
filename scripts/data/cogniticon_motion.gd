## How a cogniticon moves, as pure functions of time.
##
## The marks are drawn by `CogniticonMarks` and placed by
## `CognitionBillboard3D`; this module owns *when they are where*. Nothing here
## touches a node, holds state, or reads a frame delta -- same shape as
## `SpikeBiomechanics`, `BlockBiomechanics` and `GaitBiomechanics`, and for the
## same three reasons:
##
## - `match_screen.gd` carries a `playback_speed` from 0.1 to 4.0, and animation
##   driven by frame deltas would run at the wrong rate on a slow replay
## - the bodies are already phase-driven, so a second clock beside them is a
##   second clock to disagree with them
## - and a pure function can be gated headlessly, which is how every other
##   claim in this repository is checked
##
## ## Envelopes are in real seconds, and that is a measurement rather than a
## preference
##
## The obvious design is to run each envelope across its window as a 0-to-1
## progress. `run_window_budget_probe.gd`, 936 windows over 180 rallies, says
## that would break:
##
##     after        count     p10   median    mean     p90     min
##     ATTACK         210    0.03     0.33    0.63    1.62    0.02
##     BLOCK           59    0.22     0.29    0.36    0.63    0.22
##     DEFENSE        116    0.23     0.73    0.82    1.59    0.13
##     RECEPTION      161    1.35     1.43    1.41    1.48    0.91
##     SERVE          180    1.03     1.10    1.10    1.19    0.95
##     SET            210    0.87     1.00    1.13    1.50    0.59
##     ALL            936    0.22     1.06    0.97    1.48    0.02
##
## The slash lives on the attack's window, whose median is a third of a second
## and whose tenth percentile is **three hundredths**. A window-relative slash
## would be played out in two frames on a fast swing and stretched over a second
## and a half on a roll shot -- which is exactly the defect `BlockPhaseModel`
## was written to remove from the block's jump. A body's motion is its own
## duration; so is a mark's.
##
## So every envelope below is in seconds, clamped, and **allowed to keep running
## past the end of its window** into the next one. `BLOCK_DESCENT_SECONDS` in
## `match_screen.gd` already works this way and is the precedent.
##
## The other thing that table says: the swoop and the charge are comfortable.
## Blades arrive on the set's window (median 1.0 s) and the serve charges over
## its own (median 1.10 s), so a 0.22 s arrival has four times the room it needs.
## Only the reactions are tight, and reactions should be fast anyway.

## How long a mark takes to arrive. Deliberately the same order as
## `PlayerCognitionCue.FADE_SECONDS` (0.22) and `GLANCE_DWELL_SECONDS` (0.18) --
## the cue vocabulary already thinks at this scale and a mark that enters slower
## than a glance lasts would be a mark that misses its own moment.

## And leaves. Slightly quicker than it came: a sheathe is a decision already
## made, where an arrival is one being taken.
const SHEATHE_SECONDS: float = 0.18

## The blink, which is the whole of what makes an idle mark feel alive.
##
## Fast down and slower up, which is what a real blink is and what separates it
## from a pulse. Both well under the ambient motion budget by duration even
## though they exceed it by rate -- the exception is named in the design doc.

## replay of the same rally blinks identically.

const BLINK_PERIOD_SPAN: float = 2.7

## The startle. Fast in, slow out, because that is what a startle is; a
## symmetric envelope reads as a pulse and a slow one reads as dawning
## realisation, which is a different emotion and a much less useful one.

## A mark arriving: swooping in rather than appearing.
##
## Returns the transform to apply on top of the mark's resting place. The fade
