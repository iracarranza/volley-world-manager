## What a voli does in the half-second after their feet touch down.
##
## Nothing, until now. `SpikeBiomechanics` carries an attacker through their own
## landing because the swing's phase runs past contact to +1 -- but the moment
## the attack's playback window ends, the actor stops being the contact actor and
## snaps to a neutral stand on the next frame, mid-absorb. A blocker has it worse
## and gets no landing at all: the block pose is a static wall with no phase in
## it, so a blocker drops out of the sky and is standing normally the instant
## they touch the floor.
##
## ## Landing is not the reverse of jumping
##
## A jump is a push: the body extends *into* the floor and the joints open. A
## landing is a controlled collapse -- the joints fold to spread the deceleration
## over time, and they fold in the opposite order to the way they opened, distal
## first. Ankle, then knee, then hip, then trunk. That is why a landing drawn as
## a jump played backwards reads as a bounce.
##
## The absorb is also deeper and briefer than people expect: peak knee flexion
## arrives about a third of the way through and the recovery out of it takes
## twice as long as the drop into it.
##
## ## Landing carries the action that caused it
##
## Which is the reason this takes an `action` at all. A hitter has just swung
## across their body with their weight travelling forward, so they land long and
## asymmetric and keep drifting. A blocker has jumped straight up from a squat
## and has to be ready for the next ball, so they land square, absorb less, and
## bring their hands down late. A jump server lands *inside* the court having
## come from outside it and is travelling hardest of the three.
##
## Pure and deterministic, like the other two pose modules.

## How long an absorb-and-recover takes, in seconds, for each action.
##
## A blocker's is shortest because they cannot afford a long one; a hitter's is
## longest because nothing is asking them to be ready.

## Where in the landing the knees are deepest. Early: the drop into the absorb is
## fast and the climb out of it is not.
const ABSORB_PEAK: float = 0.34

## How folded the voli already is at the instant of touchdown.
##
## Not zero, and the distinction matters twice. Physically, nobody lands on
## locked legs -- the knee is already carrying twenty-odd degrees when the foot
## meets the floor, and it is the *pre*-flexion that makes an absorb possible at
## all. Mechanically, this overlay takes over from `SpikeBiomechanics` partway
## through, at whatever frame the attack's playback window happens to end, and a
## curve starting from zero would snap the knee straight on that frame before
## folding it again.
const TOUCHDOWN_ABSORB: float = 0.38

## How briskly the voli comes off the bottom of the absorb.
##
## Above 1, so the recovery leaves the deepest point sooner than a plain cosine
## would. The recovery still takes twice as long as the drop -- that ratio is what
## makes a landing a catch rather than a bounce -- but a cosine spends most of
## that time near the bottom, and a hitter photographed at 40% and 60% of their
## landing was in a near-identical deep crouch in both. What reads as absorbing is
## passing *through* the bottom, not sitting in it.
const RECOVERY_SHARPNESS: float = 1.5

## How much of the landing a blocker's hands stay up for.
##
## A blocker does not drop their arms the instant they land -- they come down
## after the feet, and a blocker drawn with their arms already at their sides on
## the touchdown frame reads as someone who gave up on the ball.

## Every joint the landing overlay needs, for one instant of it.

## `progress` runs 0 at touchdown to 1 when the voli is standing again. Values
## outside that are clamped, so a caller that overruns its own timer gets the
## neutral stand rather than an extrapolated fold.
