## A set as a push from the floor, not as a shape made with the hands.
##
## The inline version had the right idea and half the timeline: shoulders opening
## from 96 to 132 and elbows from 98 to 22 across a `release` that reached 1.0
## **at contact** and stayed there. So the preparation was drawn and the delivery
## was not -- past phase 0 the setter held the finish position for the whole
## outgoing flight, hands stopped where the ball had been. And the legs were
## never touched at all, which left whatever the gait had last written on them:
## a setter standing straight-legged while their arms did the work.
##
## ## What a set actually is
##
## A setter does not push a ball with their arms. They get under it, load the
## legs, and *extend* -- ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, in that
## order and ending with the fingers. The arms are the last and smallest part of
## it. What the eye reads as a good set is the whole body finishing tall and
## travelling toward the target, and what it reads as a bad one is arms alone.
##
## Three things therefore have to survive past phase 0, and none of them did:
##
##   * the elbows keep opening, finishing near straight
##   * the legs keep extending, and the body rises with them
##   * the hands finish high and *out*, toward where the ball went
##
## ## The hands are together, because the ball is between them
##
## Kept from the version this replaces, along with the sign it took two attempts
## to get right: rolling an arm about +Z carries its hand toward +x, so the left
## arm takes `+flare` to converge and the right `-flare`. Reversed, a set is drawn
## as a player holding nothing. The forearms converge for the preparation *and*
## the push, and only the recovery opens them, once the ball has gone.
##
## ## Phase convention
##
## Signed, contact at 0, matching the other pose modules:
##
##   -1.0  moving to the ball, hands not yet up
##    0.0  the ball is in the hands
##   +1.0  recovered, watching the attack
##
## Pure and deterministic, and testable without a scene.

## Where each stage begins on the signed timeline.
##
## A setter is under the ball early -- the hands are up long before the contact,
## which is most of what separates a setter from someone catching a ball -- so
## the gather occupies the bulk of the approach and the push is short.

## The elbow is what tells a set from a block. Both put the hands above the head;
## only one keeps the arms bent. At 98 the forearms stand vertical beside the
## head, which is the shape a setter waits in, and opening toward 4 is the push

## How far the setter comes **off the floor** at the finish, in metres.
##
## Only the rise, and deliberately not the dip. The dip is already paid for: the
## knee folds to -46 in the gather and `_ground_the_feet` turns that fold into a
## body drop of about 0.10 m so the shoes stay on the ground. Adding a second
## explicit crouch on top would lower the body a second time and put the feet
## through the floor -- which is exactly the defect the dig had, and it is worth
## saying out loud that this module nearly repeated it.
##
## The rise is different in kind. A setter finishing a good ball comes up onto
## the toes and travels toward the target, so this genuinely is elevation and not
## a fold, and it is the one part of the vertical motion that has to be added
## rather than derived.
const EXTEND_RISE_METRES: float = 0.05

## The legs. Loaded under the ball, driven straight through the push, and the

## The three ways a second ball leaves the hands, and what separates them.
##
## `standing` is the push this module was written for: the legs load, drive, and
## the heels come off the floor. The other two are not variations of it.
##
## `jump` takes the floor away. A setter in the air cannot push off anything, so
## the legs stop being the engine and become ballast -- they fold *under* the
## body and stay folded, the split closes because there is no stance to take,
## and every newton the ball receives has to come from the shoulders and the
## hands. That is why the arm travel is larger here and the leg travel is
## nearly nothing: the same ball, out of a body with one fewer joint working.
##
## `underhand` is the ball that never got to hand height. The forearms take it,
## the arms stay long and low and swing as one piece from the shoulders, and the
## finish is a *point*: the whole body extends up behind the ball because the
## only way to put a low ball high is to stand up into it. Its signal already
## exists -- `_jump_set_decision` publishes `under the hands` as the reason a
## setter stayed down, 136 times in 1,342 sets.
const POSTURE_STANDING := &"standing"
const POSTURE_JUMP := &"jump"
const POSTURE_UNDERHAND := &"underhand"

## How high the body actually goes on a jump set, in metres before body scaling.
##
## A set jump is not a spike jump. A setter leaves the floor to meet the ball
## sooner and flatter, not to get as high as they can -- so this is well under
## `BlockJumpModel`'s leaps and is deliberately not derived from them.
const JUMP_RISE_METRES: float = 0.34
## The knees fold and stay folded. There is no drive in the air, so the legs
## hold one shape from take-off to landing rather than passing through it.
const JUMP_TUCK_KNEE_DEGREES: float = -58.0
## Everything the legs stop contributing has to come from somewhere. A jump
## setter's hands travel further and finish higher for the same ball.
const JUMP_SHOULDER_BONUS_DEGREES: float = 14.0

## The underhand set. Long arms, low contact, and a finish that goes straight up.
const UNDERHAND_SHOULDER_READY_DEGREES: float = -46.0
const UNDERHAND_SHOULDER_CONTACT_DEGREES: float = -14.0
## **The point.** The follow-through carries past the ball and finishes with the
## platform aimed at the ceiling, which is the whole read of an underhand set:
## a bump goes where the arms end up, so a ball meant to go up needs arms that
## end up pointing there.
const UNDERHAND_SHOULDER_FINISH_DEGREES: float = 62.0
## Straight. A platform is two forearms locked into one surface, and a bent
## elbow is the thing that makes a bump go sideways.
const UNDERHAND_ELBOW_DEGREES: float = 3.0
## Deeper than a standing set and it stays deep longer: the legs are what lift a
## low ball, and they extend *through* the contact rather than before it.
const UNDERHAND_KNEE_LOAD_DEGREES: float = -62.0
const UNDERHAND_RISE_METRES: float = 0.17

## ## Setting backwards
##
## A back set is the same three postures done to a ball the setter is not facing,
## and it was drawn identically to a front set because playback faces the rig at
## wherever the ball went -- so every setter on this branch has been squaring up
## to the target and pushing, including the ones delivering behind their own
## head. That is the one second-contact shape a viewer can name on sight, and it
## was the one shape the model could not make.
##
## It is an overlay rather than a fourth posture, because it is not a fourth
## action: a jumping back set and a standing back set differ exactly as a jumping
## front set and a standing one do. What changes in all three is the same three
## things, and they are the three a spectator actually reads:
##
##   * the trunk **arches**, chest to the ceiling, rather than travelling forward
##   * the hands carry back **over** the head instead of finishing out in front
##   * the stance stops driving forward -- weight goes onto the back foot, so the
##     split closes and reverses rather than pushing through
##
## Applied on the delivery window and released on the recovery, so a setter
## arches into the ball and comes back down out of it rather than standing bent
## backwards for the rest of the rally.
const BACK_SET_SHOULDER_CARRY_DEGREES: float = 26.0
const BACK_SET_TORSO_ARCH_RADIANS: float = 0.22
## Negative on purpose. A front set finishes over the lead foot; a back set
## finishes over the trailing one, and a scale that only shrank the split would
## draw the difference as "less of a stance" rather than as the other stance.
const BACK_SET_HIP_SPLIT_SCALE: float = -0.40


## Every joint of a set at one instant.
##
## `hand` is +1 for a right-hander and -1 for a left-hander and mirrors only the
## foot split. A set is a symmetric action; nothing else in it has a handedness.
##
## `posture` selects between the three actions above. It defaults to standing so
## every existing caller is unchanged, and the simulator already publishes the
## value on the SET event as `set_posture`.
##
## `back_set` is orthogonal to `posture` and is applied to all three -- see the
## note above `BACK_SET_SHOULDER_CARRY_DEGREES`.
