## How one cue reads as a picture, in one place, for every renderer.
##
## The 2D tactical board draws with `draw_*` calls into a `Control`; the 3D
## billboard builds meshes facing a camera. They share no drawing code and must
## share every meaning, so the translation from semantics to appearance lives
## here and each renderer only decides how to put a circle on the screen.
##
## **Colour is never the only signal.** Every field this returns is redundant
## with another: an urgent cue is red *and* has a wide eye *and* carries `!`. A
## viewer who cannot separate the reds still reads the badge, and so does anyone
## looking at a greyscale screenshot in a bug report.

const CueModel := preload("res://scripts/models/player_cognition_cue.gd")

## What each state is called, on a board that has to be read rather than
## decoded.
##
## Volleyball words where the sport has one and plain ones where it does not.
## `READ` is a voli watching the play develop, `SEES` is the instant they pick
## it up, `CALL` is the only one another player can hear, and `BLIND` is a
## defender who has lost the ball behind the wall.

## The full drawable reading of one cue.

## `pupil` is a unit-ish offset in the renderer's own screen space, so the
## caller supplies the direction to whatever the cue is attending to and this
## decides how far the eye travels toward it. A cue attending to nothing looks
## straight ahead rather than at the court's origin, which is what a raw
## `Vector2.ZERO` attention position would otherwise produce.
