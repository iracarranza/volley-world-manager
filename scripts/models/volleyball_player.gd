	## blocker and a poor one 0 cm, so almost every swing met hands and the
	## contest had no room to resolve. Widening the leap widens the attacking
	## advantage without touching `standing_reach_cm()`, and it moves the contest
	## off body height -- which a player is born with -- and onto jump and
	## explosiveness, which they can train.

	## It also puts contact where the sport puts it. A hitter now meets the ball
