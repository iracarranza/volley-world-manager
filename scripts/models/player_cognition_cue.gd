class_name PlayerCognitionCue
extends Resource

## A replay-safe statement about what one player is attending to, deciding, or
## feeling during a rally.  This is semantic evidence: renderers decide how an
## eye, flame, face, punctuation mark, or arrow depicts it.
##
## **A cue never names a picture.** `state`, `attention_kind` and `affect` are
## the vocabulary; an eye shape, a call symbol or a colour is a renderer's
## reading of them. The 2D badge and the 3D billboard consume the same cue and
## must agree on meaning without agreeing on geometry, which is only possible if
## nothing here is a sprite name.
##
## **A cue carries only what its player perceived.** The resolver knows where
## the ball actually went; a blocker reading the setter does not. Grading an
## outcome is allowed after the decision boundary the cue describes, never
## before it -- otherwise the badge shows a player being certain about something
## they had no way to know, which is the one failure that would make the whole
## layer read as fake.

## The closed vocabularies. Declared rather than left as loose strings because
## two renderers and one compiler have to agree on them, and a typo in a
## `StringName` is silent everywhere.

## What this voli is preparing to do with their body.
##
## A third axis, and it has to be a third axis rather than more `STATES` values,
## because it is orthogonal to both of the others: a voli can be `committed`,
## attending the `ball`, and either dropping into a dig posture or winding up to
## swing. Same state, same attention, opposite readings. Nothing else here can
## tell those two apart.
##
## `watching` is in the list deliberately. A vocabulary with no term for "nothing
## in particular" invites whoever compiles a continuous stream to invent an
## intent to fill a gap -- which is the drifting-volis defect moved from the legs
## to the icons, and it is worse there because it is a claim about a mind.

## How the eyes are being spent, which is not the same question as where they
## point.
##
## A receiver who checks their partner and looks away has *finished*: they got
## what they needed in a fifth of a second. A blocker holding the setter has not
## finished and will not until the ball leaves. Both are `attention_kind:
## teammate` or `setter` for their whole duration, so `ATTENTION_KINDS` alone
## cannot separate a question from a vigil -- and telling them apart at a glance
## is most of what makes the layer readable.

##
## **This is how far along, never how likely.** A hitter who will arrive late
## still fills their bar, because they are running; the lateness reads as the bar
## not being full when the ball arrives. Grading it by the outcome would break
## the rule at the top of this file in the least visible and most damaging way,

## How long the glyph holds full strength before it fades, from `starts_at`.
## Negative means "as long as the cue lasts", which is the right answer for
## anything ongoing.
##
## **This is what separates the cue from its ink, and the separation is what
## makes a continuous stream survivable.** Coverage wants exactly one live cue
## per voli at every instant, so that what they are doing is always defined. A
## court with twelve glyphs burning at full strength for the whole rally is the
## opposite of legible, and it would drown the markers that currently carry the
## rally -- `lost_sight` fires 24 times in 47,000 cue-samples, and it lands
## because almost nothing else is lit.
##
## So a cue stays active and its glyph goes quiet once its message has been
## sent. A glance is the clearest case: the look is over in a fifth of a second
## and the voli keeps whatever they learned.
